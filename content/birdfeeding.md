Feeding wild birds - should you or shouldn't you?

Wild birds take care of their own. Just as with our lovely moorhen, the old feed the young, help them grow into strong adults so in time they are able to feed themselves, and, of course, their own offspring. This cycle repeats every generation, and in this way nature works harmoniously - bird feeding bird feeding bird...

What kind of dinosaur descendant do you want to break bread with? This post will focus on waterfowl. In parks and cities there are numerous types of them, geese, ducks, swans, and others. There is a lot of controversy around giving them bread and other "human" food, and I want to shed some light on this. 

First: In general, giving wild waterfowl something to eat can have negative consequences. But it is also a super cool activity. As with everything, doing super fun things in moderation is key to not let them become stale like old bread.
So at first, let's look at some of the possible problems. Afterwards, I am going to go into what to do if you don't want to give up feeding burds and how to integrate yourself with nature without causing damage.

With that in mind, what are the possible negative consequences?
