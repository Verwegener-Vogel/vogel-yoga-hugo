## vogl



Prototype of a power-independent bird youth breeding observation station.

The challenge of this project was the power supply for the embedded microcontroller board. Its power independence made it easily deployable at remote positions - far away from common power supply outlets.

Due to limitation of the computing power chosen by restraints of technology in combination with a total load in the milliamperes.

The next iteration of this project is currently in evaluation with updated single board computers. These models either have included inference accelerators like the [NVIDIA Jetson series](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-modules) or USB accelerators like [Google Coral](https://coral.ai/) in combination with cheap and low power SBCs can be utilized.

The scope is currently also expanded due to rapidly advancing improvements in object detection algorithms. Classifying bird species with integrating feeding stations are available as [Kickstarter campaigns for active birding](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bird-buddy-a-smart-bird-feeder#/).
The next level is the detection of individual birds to count their recurrent feeding behaviour, seasonal migration and growth tracking.

## Bird Feed Counter 3000


Statistical collection of bird feeding events.

Easy to deploy counter of arriving birds to feeding stations. 

The reliability of the system is due its simplicity. A feeding stations needs to be made from conductive metal. The feeding station is connected to electronics, making it a touch sensible sensor.

The bird activates this sensor by sitting on its feet to get the food.
