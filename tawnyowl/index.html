These birds are real sneaky birds. Even when they see you with their superb vision you won&rsquo;t see them. Not even when they fly over you.
Your only chance to get a glimpse at these birds is to lay low. Don&rsquo;t move as they see everything happening around them with their very special set of eyes. The eyes are not only very light sensitive similar to night vision goggles but they are similar set as human&rsquo;s eyes."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://verein.vogel.yoga/tawnyowl/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://verein.vogel.yoga/images/cover-image.jpg"><meta property="article:section" content><meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-08-26T15:23:00+02:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2021-08-26T15:23:00+02:00"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Verwegener Vogel - Vogel Yoga"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://verein.vogel.yoga/images/cover-image.jpg"><meta name=twitter:title content="Birds who see being unseen"><meta name=twitter:description content="Tawny Owls.

Most bird species have a broad field of view to see every predator.
Predators like the tawny owl have their eyes set in a way to fix the prey. To see and estimate the path towards the rat, mouse or other critter.</p><center><iframe src="https://www.xeno-canto.org/670463/embed?simple=1" scrolling=no frameborder=0 width=340 height=115></iframe></center><p>The most fearsome sign of the prey&rsquo;s upcoming demise at the sharp and precise claws of this owl is the sound of the owl.
Of course, it won&rsquo;t hear it directly before the catch as the owl&rsquo;s smartness prohibits making sounds. Alerting the prey is not the strategy of a successful predator.
The owl makes sounds only if it wants to and if the situation is right.</p><p>Tawny Owls are no birds living in groups like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_greenfinch>greenfinches</a>.
They are social nonetheless: the owl communicates with potential partners and peers. These sounds are clearly distinguishable when you go to a dark forest in the night.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t fear the tawny owl. They are fascinating birds which inspired even the Athenians who chose the bird as their sign.</p><a title="Marie-Lan Nguyen, CC BY 2.5 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5>, via Wikimedia Commons" href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tetradrachm_Athens_450_reverse_CdM_Paris_(B).jpg><img width=512 alt="Tetradrachm Athens 450 reverse CdM Paris (B)" src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Tetradrachm_Athens_450_reverse_CdM_Paris_%28B%29.jpg/512px-Tetradrachm_Athens_450_reverse_CdM_Paris_%28B%29.jpg></a><p>The wise owl who knows.
